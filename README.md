### Changing the Copyright Holder

To change the copyright holder name inserted into source files:

1. Create a file named `COPYRIGHT_HOLDER` in the root of the repository, and write your name or your organization‚Äôs name in it.
   For example:

   ```bash
   echo "Your Name or Organization" > COPYRIGHT_HOLDER
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This file is `.gitignore`'d and should not be committed.

2. Run `make annotate-SPD` (or the relevant pre-commit hook) to re-annotate modified source files with the new copyright holder name.

   - This target internally calls `reuse annotate` to update SPDX headers.
   - Only `.py` and `.sh` files tracked by git are affected.

   ```bash
   make annotate-SPD
   ```

> **Important**: The value in `COPYRIGHT_HOLDER` must be under 50 characters.
